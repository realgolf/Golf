## Requirements

To perform the necessary measurements, you will need the following equipment:

- A device capable of accurately measuring shot distances, such as a simulator or a range finder (e.g. Trackman).

**Additionally, you'll require the following items:**

- A set of golf clubs.
- At least one golf ball.

## Procedure

Follow these steps to set up and utilize the range finder to capture crucial shot parameters, including those applicable when playing at the [Silver level](https://realgolf.games/dashboard/levels) and above:

1. **Equipment Setup:**

   - Ensure your range finder is correctly configured and operational.
   - Verify its ability to accurately detect the golf ball.

2. **Key Parameters:**
   - Pay particular attention to the following essential parameters:
     - **Total/Carry Distance:** You can decide if the total distance traveled by the ball or its carry distance is important.
     - **Lateral Deviation:** When playing the [Silver level](https://realgolf.games/dashboard/levels) or above you need to include the lateral deviation and it will get harder to hit a Field of your choice.
