# Versions

There are two different versions of this game, the first version is the Server Version, which has a BackEnd and
a user authentication, the second version is a full offline working version, the whole site is cached on the first
load and can then be used without any network connection, so you can play the games on ships, planes or any where even
if you don't have a network connection.
