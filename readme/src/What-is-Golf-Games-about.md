# What is Real Golf about?

Real Golf (Golf) is about three different Games, the first one is called 4 Winning, the second one is called 
Exact, the third and for now last game is Precision

## 4 Winning

4 Winning is like four in a row, with some modification, the first modification is, that the game board has more 
columns and rows then a normal four in row, a normal four in row has a game board of 4x4, my version of four in 
a row has 8 columns and 9 rows, including the columns at the full right and full left, which just show the lateral 
deviation you are allowed to play in one of the different modes you can play the game in.

## Exact

Exact is a game which goal it is to play exact as possible to a few numbers, for example every tens give 3 points 
and all numbers with twice the same number are giving 3 Points, 100 meters gives 5 points, everything above 100 and 
below 5 gives -1 Points.

## Precision

Precision is the third game I have developed. The objective of the game is to get as close to the targets as possible. 
For every meter you miss the target, you will receive a deduction of one point. The winner of the game is the player 
with the highest points at the end. The game concludes when only one player has points remaining. You can observe the 
distance you need to shoot and the current team, along with the remaining points for each team.
