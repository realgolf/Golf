# What is Real Golf about?

Real Golf, consisting of three different games—4 Winning, Exact, and Precision—is an engaging golf experience.

## 4 Winning

4 Winning is a variation of the classic four in a row. The game board, with 8 columns and 9 rows, introduces modifications compared to the standard 4x4 board. The additional columns on the far right and left showcase lateral deviation, allowing players to explore different modes.

## Exact

Exact challenges players to hit specific numbers with precision. Scoring is based on factors like hitting every tens for 3 points, numbers with identical digits for 3 points, 100 meters for 5 points, and penalties for distances above 100 or below 5.

## Precision

Precision, the third game in Real Golf, requires players to get as close as possible to the targets. Each meter missed results in a deduction of one point. The winner is determined by the highest points at the end of the game. The game concludes when only one player has remaining points. Players can track the distance to the target, the current team, and the remaining points for each team.
