# Why did I decide to develop Real Golf?

I chose to develop Real Golf because of my passion for playing golf. With a starting handicap of 54, I dedicated myself to improvement and quickly progressed to 36.6 after just one tournament. Subsequent tournaments saw further enhancements, bringing my handicap down to 33.3. After taking a year-long break from competitive play, I recently participated in a fourth tournament and achieved my current handicap of **33.2**.
