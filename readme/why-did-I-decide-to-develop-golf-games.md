# Why did I decide to develop Golf Games?

I decided to develop Golf Games, because I love to play Golf and got an Handicap of 33.2, which
is quite alright, I improved myself from 54, which is the start Handicap, to 36.6 in just one tournament,
and then played a second one a few months later and improved to 34.5, then I played a third tournament and
improved to 33.3, after one year of break playing tournaments, I played a fourth just a few weeks ago and got
my current Handicap of **33.2**.
