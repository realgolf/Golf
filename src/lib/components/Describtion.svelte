  <h2>4 Winning</h2>

  <p>
    4 Winning is the first exicting game, which goal is to get 4 in a row, you
    can connect them vertikal, horizontal and diagonal, as soon a team gets four
    in a row, a message will be displayed. The game allways shows the current
    team and gives an option to switch the team, you can take the field from
    your oponent, so the game is more exciting. Please read the rules and levels
    of the game at <a href="/4winning">4 Winning</a>
  </p>

  <h2>Exact</h2>

  <p>
    Exact is the second game I developed, the goal of the game is to get as many
    points with a fixed number of shots (you can modify at teh beginning or
    during the game, the standard is 20 shots per team), the number you enter is
    multiplied by 2 to get the shots overall, after the (for example) 40 shots,
    the team with the most points will be displayed. You can see the amount of
    points per field at the left hand side of the game board, there's no limit
    of how often a field can get hit. Plaese read the rules and levels of the
    game at <a href="/exact">Exact</a>.

  <h2>Further information:</h2>

  <p>
    You will need a kind of trackman or a simulator to determine the exact
    length. After you have determined the length with your trackman (or like),
    you can click on the field label with the disctance you hit. The games
    updtae evrything automaticly so you don't have to think of anythink.
