  <h2>4 Winning</h2>

  <p>
    4 Winning is the first thrilling game I have developed. The goal of this
    game is to achieve a sequence of four in a row, which can be formed either
    vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Once a team successfully
    accomplishes four in a row, a message will be displayed to acknowledge their
    victory. Throughout the game, the current team is always shown, and players
    have the option to switch teams. Furthermore, an intriguing aspect of the
    game is the ability to take fields from your opponent, adding to the
    excitement and competitiveness. For complete rules and various levels of the
    game, please refer to the page on <a href="/4winning">4 Winning</a>.

  <h2>Exact</h2>

  <p>
    Exact is the second game I have developed. The objective of the game is to
    score as many points within a fixed number of shots. You have the
    flexibility to modify the number of shots at the beginning or during the
    game; the standard is 20 shots per team. The number you enter will be
    multiplied by 2 to determine the total number of shots. After the specified
    number of shots (e.g., 40 shots), the team with the highest points will be
    declared the winner. The amount of points per field is displayed on the
    left-hand side of the game board, and there is no limit to how many times a
    field can be hit. For detailed rules and game levels, please refer to the
    page on <a href="/exact">Exact</a>.

  <!-- <h2>Precision</h2>

  <p>
    Precision is the third game I have developed. The objective of the game is
    to get as close to the targets as possible. For every meter you miss the
    target, you will receive a deduction of one point. The winner of the game is
    the player with the highest points at the end. The game concludes when only
    one player has points remaining. You can observe the distance you need to
    shoot and the current team, along with the remaining points for each team.
    The game will only end if all teams have zero points except for one. For
    detailed rules, please refer to the page on <a href="/precision"
