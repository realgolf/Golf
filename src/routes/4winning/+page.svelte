      The rules of the game are very simple, it's just a kind of four-in-a-row,
      you click the button which one you hit from the distance. After the first
      team's turn, the second teams is and clicks on a field, regardless of
      whether it has already been clicked on by another team, then it's the turn
      of the next team, you can see which team it is at the top of the respective
      game recognize. The game continues until one team has four squares in a row
      or column. If you click the same field four times, a message appears telling
      you that you have clicked the same field four times. When a team wins,
      the values â€‹of the fields are reset and you can start from the beginning.
      The game automatically switches teams. All of the above information applies
