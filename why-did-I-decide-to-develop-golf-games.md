## Why did I decide to develop Golf Games?

I decided to develop Golf Games, because I love to play Golf and got an Handicap of 33.2, which
is quite alright, I improved myself from 54, which is the start Handicap, to 36.6 in just one tournament,
and then played a second one a few months later and improved to 34.5, then I played a third tournament and
improved to 33.3, after one year of break playing tournaments, I played a fourth just a few weeks ago and got
my current Handicap of **33.2**.

## Versions

There are two different versions of this game, the first version is the Server Version, which has a BackEnd and
a user authentication, the second version is a full offline working version, the whole site is cached on the first
load and can then be used without any network connection, so you can play the games on ships, planes or any where even
if you don't have a network connection.

## What is Golf games about?

Golf Games (Golf) is about three different Games, the first one is called 4 Winning, the second one is called
Exact, the third and for now last game is Precision

### 4 Winning

4 Winning is like four in a row, with some modification, the first modifaction is, that the game board has more
columns and rows then a normal four in row, a normal four in row has a game board of 4x4, my version of four in
a row has 8 columns and 9 rows, including the columns at the full right and full left, which just show the lateral
deviation you are allowed to play in one of the diffrent modes you can play the game in.

### Exact

Exact is a game which goal it is to play exact as possible to a few numbers, for example every tens give 3 points
and all numbers with twice the same number are giving 3 Points, 100 meters gives 5 points, everything above 100 and
below 5 gives -1 Points.

### Precision

Precision is the third game I have developed. The objective of the game is to get as close to the targets as possible.
For every meter you miss the target, you will receive a deduction of one point. The winner of the game is the player
with the highest points at the end. The game concludes when only one player has points remaining. You can observe the
distance you need to shoot and the current team, along with the remaining points for each team.
